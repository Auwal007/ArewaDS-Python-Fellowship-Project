## Most-Starred Python Projects Visualization

This project uses GitHub's API to gather data on the most-starred Python repositories and visualizes the data in an interactive bar chart using Plotly. The chart displays the relative popularity of Python projects based on their star counts, with features such as clickable project links, descriptive tooltips, and customizable styling.

### Features
- **Interactive Bar Chart**: Each bar represents a Python project, and clicking on the labels takes you directly to the project's GitHub page.
- **Custom Tooltips**: Displays the project's owner and description when hovering over a bar.
- **Dynamic Data**: Fetches real-time data using GitHub's API.
- **Custom Styling**: Includes custom colors, transparency, and enhanced chart labels.

### Key Highlights
1. **GitHub API Integration**: Makes API calls to fetch repository data, including names, owners, stars, descriptions, and URLs.
2. **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Plotly to create an interactive and informative chart.
3. **Styling and Accessibility**: Implements styling changes and interactive features like hover effects and clickable links for enhanced user experience.

### Requirements
- Python
- Required Libraries: `requests`, `plotly`

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Run the script to generate the visualization.

### Credit
This project is based on **Chapter 17 of *Python Crash Course* (3rd Edition) by Eric Matthes**. It is an implementation of the concepts and techniques outlined in the book, with additional customization. Full credit for the original project idea goes to the author.
