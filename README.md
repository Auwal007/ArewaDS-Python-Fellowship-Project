## GitHub API Data Visualization: Most-Starred Python Projects

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub's API to retrieve data on the most-starred Python repositories and visualize the results with an interactive bar chart using Plotly. It provides insights into popular Python projects by showcasing their star count, owners, and descriptions.

---

### Overview
- **Purpose**: To create a real-time, interactive visualization of GitHub data.
- **Data Source**: GitHub API v3.
- **Visualization Tool**: Plotly for dynamic and interactive chart rendering.

---

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Uses GitHub’s API to retrieve the most-starred Python repositories.
- **Interactive Bar Chart**: Displays project names, star counts, and descriptions. Clickable project names link directly to their GitHub pages.
- **Custom Tooltips**: Displays the project owner and description when hovering over bars.
- **Plotly Customization**: Styled with custom colors and transparency.

---

### How to Use
1. **Clone this repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/most-starred-python-projects.git
   cd most-starred-python-projects
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**:  
   Use a Jupyter-compatible environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code) to run the file:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook github_api_visualization.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run the cells**:  
   Execute each cell to fetch the data, process it, and generate the visualization.

4. **Interactive Visualization**:  
   The notebook will display an interactive chart showing the most-starred Python repositories. Click on project names to visit their GitHub pages.

---

### Example Visualization
- The bar chart shows repository names, star counts, and custom tooltips.
- Clickable labels allow direct access to each project's GitHub page.

---

### Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **Dependencies**:  
  - `requests` for API calls  
  - `plotly` for visualization

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install requests plotly
```
